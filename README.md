:hammer_and_wrench: I'm Dinh Tuan and **I live to solve problems using analytics!** 

For me, data analysis is a way to identify a pattern, to detect a key problem among outliers and to tell a valuable story to make an impact :bar_chart:.

**Fun Facts:**
- :writing_hand: I spent hours to learn **```SQL```**, **```Python```**, **```Google Analytics```**, and visualisation tools such as **```Power BI```**, **```Tableau```** and **```Data Studio```**.
- :sparkles: **My greatest passion:** using Data Visualisation to tell story within data and derive insights for business success.
